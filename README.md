# Planet-Life-Cheat
Planet Life hasn't been hacked until now. Here is the first official cheat for Planet Like that takes advantage of Base64 encryption which was used to decompile and recompile the encrypted save file.

This cheat includes:
- Infinite Gold
- Infinite Wood
- Infinite Stardust
- Infinite Coco

Anyway this is just my base save file with a few Hexidecimal and Base64 edits to make a cheat.
Obviously the Base64 save seed and the decompiled save will be included in this cheat. (Note: To cheat at coolmathgame's version make sure to re-encrypt it in Base64 and use the developer application console).
You'll need to recompile it or use my browser cheat (.planet) file provided in the repository.
